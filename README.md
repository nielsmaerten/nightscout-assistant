# Nightscout for Google Home & Google Assistant
### _Heads up!_ Nightscout Status has been succeeded by [Gluco Check](https://github.com/nielsmaerten/gluco-check).
Gluco Check includes new features such as reading your Carbs on Board and when you last changed your sensor. 

We recommend you [upgrade to Gluco Check](https://glucocheck.app) if it's available in your preferred language.  
Nightscout Status will keep working until Gluco Check until has been fully translated, but will receive no new features.
