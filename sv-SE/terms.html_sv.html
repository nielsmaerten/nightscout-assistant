    <p>Detta dokument beskriver informationen som samlas in av Nightscout Status, <br>
      https://nielsmaerten.github.io/nightscout-assistant
("Tjänsten" eller "Mjukvaran") och hur denna information används.</p>

    <strong>Vilken information samlas in?</strong>
    <p>
      The Service needs 2 things in order to work: <em>the email address</em> of your Google Account
      (so it can know it's you when you make a request), <br>
      and the <em>URL of your Nightscout</em> instance (so it can look up your glucose and read it to you).
    </p>

    <strong>How is this information used?</strong>
    <p>
      When you invoke the Service through Google Assistant
      (i.e.: by saying: 'Hey Google, talk to Nightscout Status),
      <br> the Service looks at your email address, and checks if there's a Nightscout site associated with it.
      <br> If so, your current glucose level is read from your Nightscout site.
    </p>

    <strong>Sharing of information</strong>
    <p>
      Your email address or Nightscout URL will <strong>never</strong> be shared with a third party.
      <br>
      I just need it so I know which Nightscout site to check when you invoke the Action.
      <br>
      Data from your Nightscout website is not saved, not even to log files.
      <br>
    </p>

    <strong>Deleting your data</strong>
    <p>
      You can choose to revoke access at any time:
      Simply via <a href="index.html">log in</a>,
      remove your Nightscout URL, and click Save. <br>
      You can also remove Nightscout Status from your
      <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800">Google Account</a>.
      <br>
    </p>
